# Chess

A functional, UI driven game of chess. To play, download the repository and run 'Chess_Interface.py', ensuring that 'Chess_Icons' and 'Chess_Logic' are present in the same directory.


The next steps are to implement variations of traditional chess, such as the Indian 'Chaturanga' and a variant which is a compilation of some of the more interesting bugs I have come across. Ways to apply AI to the game are also being explored.
